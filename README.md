Project Submission Format: In this repo, see DL4H_Team_118.ipynb

Reproducibility: See/run the code in DL4H_Team_118.ipynb.  Key things to keep in mind:
1. Authors' original repository https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/DuETT.git
2. Environment must be running Python 3.9 (or specifically between 3.7 - 3.10)
3. All dependencies are to be downloaded exactly in the original repo's requirements.txt

Results and Analysis: See the results included in DL4H_Team_118.ipynb.  Note that due to computational complexity versus time limitations, some of the more intensive steps (e.g. 300 training epochs and 50 fine tuning epochs) needed to be run on a virtual machine with strong hardware acceleration.
